            <h2>Meaning of HTML5</h2>
            <p>HTML5 stands for HyperText Markup Language version 5. It is the latest standard for creating and structuring content on the web. HTML5 introduces new semantic elements, multimedia support, and improved performance, making it easier for developers to build modern, accessible, and responsive websites. It allows web browsers to better understand the meaning of each section of a page, which helps with both accessibility and search engine optimization.

            <h2>Why Accessibility Matters</h2>
            <p>
                Accessibility ensures that websites are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities such as visual, hearing, motor, or cognitive impairments. By following accessibility best practices—like using alt text for images, clear headings, keyboard-friendly navigation, and ARIA labels—developers create more inclusive experiences. Accessible websites improve usability for all users, help meet legal requirements, and reach a wider audience, making the web a better place for everyone.

            <h2>Understanding SEO Basics</h2>
            <p>
                SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the process of improving a website’s visibility on search engines like Google. Basic SEO techniques include using clear and descriptive page titles, adding meta descriptions, structuring content with proper headings, and using relevant keywords naturally in your text. Optimizing images with alt text and creating clean, readable URLs also help search engines understand your content. Good SEO increases the chances of your web pages appearing in search results, making it easier for people to find your site online.

            <h2>How Semantic HTML Improves Accessibility and SEO</h2>
            <p>
              Semantic HTML uses meaningful tags like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> to describe the structure of a web page. These tags help screen readers and search engines understand the purpose of each section. As a result, websites become easier to navigate for users with disabilities and are more likely to rank higher in search engine results. Using semantic tags not only improves usability but also builds a strong foundation for scalable, maintainable web development.
